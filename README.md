# demo-twitchTV
A demo learned from freeCodeCamp.

user story:



- I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

- I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

- If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

 An example call to Twitch.tv's JSONP API at [http://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/use-the-twitchtv-json-api/19541](http://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/use-the-twitchtv-json-api/19541).

The relevant documentation about this API call is here:[https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/v5/reference/streams#get-stream-by-user](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/v5/reference/streams#get-stream-by-user)

Due to a change in conditions on API usage explained here Twitch.tv now requires an API key, but can use **https://wind-bow.gomix.me/twitch-api** instead of **twitch's API base URL** (i.e. https://api.twitch.tv/kraken ) and you'll still be able to get account information, without needing to sign up for an API key.
